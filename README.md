# Tables
Bugs:
 - **JSON** is not compatible with objects so, it will become the _object tag_

Controls:
 - Most of the controls are 'explained' in <u>main.py</u>

Info:
 - I made a <u>settings.py</u> to decide certain things

Things to mention:
 - I finally got the "YongbinFan..." fixed. Who-hoo!!
 - This is just for fun!! :D
 - This isn't the final version!

C u soon!!! (I'm finally finished with django, so hopefully I can upload more now :D)
